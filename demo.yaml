  In the modern retail landscape, the friction between discovery and purchase is where most conversions are lost. **OmniShop** leverages the Google Customer Engagement Suite to transform the traditional "support ticket" into a continuous, personalized shopping conversation. 

  This demo illustrates a seamless customer journey where a single, generative AI-powered agent follows the shopper across web, mobile, and voice interfaces, acting less like a bot and more like a dedicated personal stylist and logistics expert.

  ### Core Capabilities: The "Persistent Thread"

  The hallmark of this demo is the **Persistent Context Engine**. Unlike siloed chatbots, OmniShop maintains a unified state of the user’s intent, cart, and emotional sentiment across every touchpoint.

  * **Discovery to Cart:** The agent uses multimodal Gemini models to process natural language queries like, *"I need an outfit for a beach wedding in Bali that matches these shoes,"* while analyzing an uploaded photo.
  * **Omnichannel Fluidity:** A customer can start a conversation on an Instagram DM, move to a live web chat for sizing advice, and finalize the payment via a Google Assistant voice command—all without repeating their information.
  * **Sentiment-Aware Support:** The suite detects frustration in real-time. If a shipping delay is identified, the agent proactively offers a discount or escalates to a human "Power Agent" who receives a full AI-generated summary of the interaction.

  

  ### Integrated Commerce Ecosystem

  OmniShop isn't just a front-end interface; it is deeply integrated into the retail backend to provide "Zero-Touch" resolutions:

  1.  **Real-Time Inventory Sync:** The agent queries live stock levels and warehouse locations to provide hyper-accurate delivery estimates.
  2.  **Automated Returns & Exchanges:** Using the **Agentic Workflow** feature, the AI can initiate return labels, verify refund eligibility, and suggest a replacement size in a single turn.
  3.  **Predictive Personalization:** By analyzing past purchase history and current browsing behavior, the agent suggests high-affinity "Complete the Look" items, increasing Average Order Value (AOV) through helpfulness rather than intrusive ads.
